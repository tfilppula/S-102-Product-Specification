*Title*:: Bathymetric Surface

*Abstract*:: The Bathymetric Surface Product consists of a set of values organized to form a regular set of grid coverages, with associated metadata, for an area of the sea, river, lake, or other body of water. The final grid coverages include a depth value and optional associated uncertainty estimate for each grid cell in the matrix.
